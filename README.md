## Description

This is a mobile web application for internal delivery, built with Next.js on the frontend and NestJS on the backend. The project was developed a long time ago, and despite some refactoring, it still has a lot of problems.

## Current Issues

- **Code duplication**: A significant number of repetitive components and styles.
- **Project structure**: Needs improvement and optimization.
- **Outdated dependencies**: Some libraries require updates.
- **Testing**: Lacks sufficient test coverage.

## Possible Improvements

- Refactoring to eliminate code duplication.
- Enhancing architecture and improving logic separation.
- Updating dependencies.
- Adding test coverage for key parts of the application.
- Rewriting styles using Tailwind CSS.
